## Design Guidelines

### Visual Design

- **Color Scheme**: Primary colors reflect the BURN brand identity with complementary colors for status indicators and actions
- **Typography**: Sans-serif fonts for readability across devices
- **Iconography**: Consistent, intuitive icons with labels for improved accessibility
- **Layout**: Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations

### Interaction Design

- **Navigation**: Intuitive navigation with clear hierarchy and breadcrumbs
- **Actions**: Prominent call-to-action buttons with consistent positioning
- **Feedback**: Visual and textual feedback for all user actions
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with recovery options
- **Loading States**: Appropriate loading indicators for asynchronous operations

### Accessibility Considerations

- **Text Size**: Adjustable text size for users with visual impairments
- **Color Contrast**: High contrast ratios for text and interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper labeling for screen reader compatibility
- **Offline Support**: Graceful degradation for areas with poor connectivity
- **Language Support**: Multi-language interface with localized content
- **Low-Literacy Support**: Visual cues and simplified interfaces for users with limited literacy

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- **Responsive Framework**: Implement using a responsive framework like Bootstrap or Material UI
- **Progressive Web App**: Consider PWA capabilities for offline functionality
- **API Integration**: Design with RESTful API integration in mind
